This provides the opportunity for researchers in both domains to validate calculations or measurements almost instantaneously and use the disseminated data for integrated materials studies. With the public announcement of our general contribution framework, MPContribs, we present a sustainable solution for well-curated data management, organization and dissemination in the context of MP. The framework serves the purpose of collectively maintaining contributions to MP community databases as annotations to existing MP materials.

Project information is retrievable through the projects resource, and the corresponding contributed data through the contributions resource. Each project can contain many contributions for an MP material or composition. Each contribution in turn consists of three (optional) components: free-form hierarchical data, tabular data, and crystal structures. There are separate dedicated resource endpoints for tables and structures both of which are referenced in the contributions. To get started, install the python client library mpcontribs-client for the MPContribs API: pip install mpcontribs-client Then get your API key from the MPContribs Dashboard and set up the client: from mpcontribs.client import load_client client = load_client ( \"your-api-key-here\" ) dir ( client ) # show available resources Check out the API Docs for more details about the available resources and operations shown below. The docs can also be used to try out the API in the browser. Note Only the operation methods are shown in the following sections.
