As a result, they wish to help with MP's efforts by contributing back, but also ask for support in sharing their experimental and computational datasets alongside MP's curated results. This provides the opportunity for researchers in both domains to validate calculations or measurements almost instantaneously and use the disseminated data for integrated materials studies. With the public announcement of our general contribution framework, MPContribs, we present a sustainable solution for well-curated data management, organization and dissemination in the context of MP. The framework serves the purpose of collectively maintaining contributions to MP community databases as annotations to existing MP materials. It subsequently disseminates them through MP's materials details pages as well as its portal and API .
